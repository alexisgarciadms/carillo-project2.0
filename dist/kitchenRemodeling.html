                    It all starts with an initial phone call. During the call, you just let us know what
                     you’re looking to do with the space versus what you’ve got now, as well as the design 
                     elements you have in mind. From there, a member of our team will travel to your location 
                     for an initial estimate and assess the situation. After that, we’ll get to work and before

			    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
			    <p>The process of renovating a kitchen may seem daunting when it first comes to mind. Immediately, 
                    people think of it as a big project that will serve as an inconvenience during your day-to-day 
                    life. That’s not to mention the financial side of just how much it will cost, either. It’s 
                    definitely a big project and one that should not be taken lightly. But given how much time you 
                    spend in your home each day, why not have the kitchen you’ve always wanted?</p>
